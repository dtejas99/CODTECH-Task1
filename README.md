# Project Overview:


# Project : Basic Calculator in Python


## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a simple, interactive command-line calculator in Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project aims to help beginners understand fundamental programming concepts such as user input, functions, conditional statements, and basic error handling.

## Key Activities:
### Requirement Analysis:

Identify the basic arithmetic operations the calculator should support: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Determine how to handle special cases, such as division by zero.

### Design:

Define a simple, user-friendly interface that prompts the user for inputs.
Plan the flow of the program to ensure it guides the user through the operation selection process.
Outline functions for each arithmetic operation to modularize the code and enhance readability.

### Implementation:

#### User Input Handling:
Prompt the user to input two numbers.
Prompt the user to select the desired operation.
#### Function Development:
Implement separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
#### Conditional Logic:
Implement logic to call the appropriate function based on the user's operation choice.
Include error handling, such as checking for division by zero.
#### Testing:
Test the calculator with various inputs to ensure it performs all operations correctly.
Test edge cases, such as entering non-numeric values or attempting division by zero.
#### Documentation:

Write clear documentation explaining how the calculator works, including how to input numbers and select operations.
Include comments in the code to describe the purpose of each function and important code blocks.
#### User Experience Improvement (Optional):

Add features like looping, so the user can perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
Include input validation to handle incorrect or unexpected inputs more gracefully.
## Expected Outcome:
By the end of the project, you will have a fully functional basic calculator that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations through a command-line interface. The project will also reinforce your understanding of Python programming basics.

## Additional Points:
#### Scalability:
The project can be expanded in the future to include more complex operations (e.g., exponentiation, square roots) or a graphical user interface (GUI).
#### Learning Outcomes: 
You'll gain hands-on experience with Python syntax, function creation, error handling, and user interaction through the console.

This overview should help guide your development process and keep the project organized and focused.
